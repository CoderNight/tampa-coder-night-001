# Turtle Tracks

This code implements the [Turtle Tracks](http://puzzlenode.com/puzzles/9-turtle-tracks) challenge for Tampa CoderNight.

## Goal

In this code I'm practicing if I can implement the turtle tracks as directly evaluating the input as code.

This will probably be implemented in something that takes the input language into something that can be evaluated as Ruby.
