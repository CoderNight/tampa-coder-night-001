# Tampa Coder Night

These are anonymous submissions for the first Tampa Coder Night.

CoderNight is a chance to practice your coding skills outside your work environment or help get started if you are just learning. CoderNight provides an ego-free environment to perform deliberate coding practice and to receive critical but judgement free feedback on your progress.

CoderNight welcomes people of all skill levels from "I just wrote my first line of code" to "I have invented my own language"

## How does it work?

We send out a homework statement a few weeks before the meeting. You'll complete the assignment and submit your code anonymously (you may submit more than one entry). About a week before the meeting we'll start sharing solutions for everyone to read and review. During the meeting, the group will review and provide feedback for the posted solutions. The sole purpose of the meeting is to provide feedback to those who submitted code and ONE guest.
